    "bio":"The Honeypot Attack Visualizer is a web application that provides a rich interface for filtering and visualizing previous attacks on a set of honeypots. The visualizer is designed to utilize data from the Cybex-P project at the University of Nevada, Reno. Cybex-P allows security researchers to share details on cyber threats while preserving privacy, although it does not provide ways to analyze the data. The Honeypot Attack Visualizer seeks to fill that role. A map forms the foundation for the visualizer. Honeypot attacks are then presented on a GPU-accelerated map overlay that allows the attacks to be depicted in a variety of formats. The specific attacks that are included in the overlay and the format they are shown in are controlled through numerous options and filters. These options and filters aim to provide users with new perspectives on the same data and help create connections between different parts of the data. ",

The book specifically covers how honeypots can be used to mimic services such as HTTP, SSH, and RDP. Additionally, tips on monitoring honeypots and how to use the their logs to conduct anaylsis are covered which is one of main challenges that the Honeypot Attack Visualizer is trying to cover."

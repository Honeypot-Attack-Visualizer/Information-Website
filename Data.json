    "bio":"The Honeypot Attack Visualizer is designed to provide users with real time data on locations and variations of attacks           that are occurring around the world. The data from the honeypots is displayed on a web based application that provides           users with a map and options to control what data types they prefer to be visualized. The data is collected through the          utilization of multiple honeypots located in several cities around the world that log all incoming attacks. These data           entries range from attacks directed at specific honeypots, the number of attacks, and a specific date or a range of              dates. The intended users are cybersecurity professionals or organizations looking to understand the many different              attack attempts that exist in the world. It would benefit experts by providing insight on potential threats that may             target their systems in the future along with their origins. For the general public, the visualization would provide an          estimate or sample of the many cyber attacks that exist through an interactive web application. The Honeypot Attack              Visualizer utilizes a variety of technologies to provide users with engaging visualization of attacks. For the                   front-end, the map and its options are displayed using React, Deck.gl, Google Maps, and Mapbox. The map receives data            from a database server that runs on MySQL and conducts automated daily updates of honeypot data through the use of                Python scripts.",

The book specifically covers how honeypots can be used to mimic services such as HTTP, SSH, and RDP. Additionally, tips on monitoring honeypots and how to use the their logs to conduct anaylsis are covered which is one of main challenges that the Honeypot Attack Visualizer is trying to cover."
